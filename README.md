To send message on your Whatsapp, first you need to create an acount on Twilio and Invite your friends to your Sandbox by sending a WhatsApp message code  as mentioned under the option "Set up your Testing Sandbox". In my case the code was "join pleasure-properly" attached in whatsapp screenshot below , it will be different for every individual user.
You can find ACCOUNT_SID & AUTH_TOKEN under Account Info. You need to input both of these in the code.
Also provide the auto generated phone number of Twilio Whatsapp starting with +14*********6 and to receive message provide your whatsapp number from which you have sended the join code on whatsapp previously.
